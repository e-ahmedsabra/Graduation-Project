+ Types of Scientific/Academic Resources:

1) https://library.redlands.edu/c.php?g=98510&p=657351

N.B. As I've informed you during our initial meetings, you should start with "Review Articles." Then, throughout your work, you should rely "mostly" on Peer-Reviewed Articles, Dissertations & Theses, Books, and Conference Proceedings.

+ What is a Review Article, & the Differences between a Research Paper and a Review Paper?

+ Finally, what is a Comparative Study?

As I've informed you throughout our meetings, (1) You can demonstrate mastering a topic by doing a comparative study, (2) It's publishable, (3) It's quite easier in many cases than doing an original contribution, (4) Lots of projects - especially on the Masters & PhD levels - start by carrying out a Comparative Study, (5) If done properly, it will very likely give you credible ideas for doing your own original contribution, (6) However, on a Graduation Project's level, it's quite sufficient for the team to carry out one.

And, these are 2 quite short comparative studies that I’ve written more than 10 years ago, when I was a fresh graduate. They’ll hopefully give you an Idea on how it should look like.
